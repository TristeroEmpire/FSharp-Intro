# Programming in FSharp
##MOOC from edX.org and providing by Microsoft.

Some of the solutions use mutable values. The main purpose of the MOOC is NOT about the functional programming but programming with F sharp !

Solutions for the problems :
- Module 1
- Module 2
- Module 3
And because I'm lazy I didn't do the last one :)
